		<p id="intro"><abbr title="White Water Rafting">WWR</abbr> or <strong>white water rafting</strong> is the recreational     outdoor activity of using an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other bodies of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water, in order to thrill and excite the raft passengers. The development of this activity as a leisure sport has become popular since the mid-1970s, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a tour guide at the stern. It is considered an extreme sport, and can be fatal.</p>

		<h2>Grades of white water</h2>
		<p>Main article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Scale_of_River_Difficulty">International Scale of River Difficulty</a></p>
		<p>Otherwise known as the International Scale of River Difficulty, below are the six grades of difficulty in white water rafting. They range from simple to very dangerous and potential death or serious injuries.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Grade 1:</strong> Very small rough areas, might require slight maneuvering. (Skill level: very basic)</li>
			<li><strong>Grade 2:</strong> Some rough water, maybe some rocks, might require some maneuvering. (Skill level: basic paddling skill)</li>
			<li><strong>Grade 3:</strong> Whitewater, small waves, maybe a small drop, but no considerable danger. May require significant maneuvering.</li>
			<li><strong>Grade 4:</strong> Whitewater, medium waves, maybe rocks, maybe a considerable drop, sharp maneuvers may be needed.</li>
			<li><strong>Grade 5:</strong> Whitewater, large waves, large volume, possibility of large rocks and hazards, possibility of a large drop, requires precise maneuvering.</li>
			<li><strong>Grade 6:</strong> Class 6 rapids are considered to be so dangerous that they are effectively unnavigable on a reliably safe basis. Rafters can expect to encounter substantial whitewater, huge waves, huge rocks and hazards, and/or substantial drops that will impart severe impacts beyond the structural capacities and impact ratings of almost all rafting equipment. Traversing a Class 6 rapid has a dramatically increased likelihood of ending in serious injury or death compared to lesser classes.</li>
		</ul>	
		

		<h2 id="techs"> Techniques</h2>
		<p id="notes">NOTE - Rafts in white water are very different vehicles than canoes or kayaks and have their own specific techniques to maneuver through whitewater obstacles. Examples of these techniques include.</p>

		<p>Punching – Rafts carry great momentum, and on rivers hydraulics that are dodged by canoes and kayaks are often punched by rafts. This involves the rafting crew paddling the raft to give it enough speed to push through the hydraulic without getting stopped.</p>
		<p>High siding – If a raft is caught in a hydraulic it will often quickly go sideways. In order to stop the raft flipping on its inside edge, the rafters can climb to the side of the raft furthest downstream, which will also be the side of the raft highest in the air leading to its name. In this position the rafters may be able to use the draw stroke to pull the raft out of the head.</p>

					<td>Swift current with riffles and small waves. Few obstacles, all obvious and easily avoided.</td>					
					<td>Easy rapids with wide-open channels and medium-sized waves. Some maneuvering may be necessary to avoid obstacles. Generally, children four years and older may experience Class II rapids.</td>
					<td>Moderate rapids with irregular, medium- to large-sized waves. Waves large enough to cause a boat to capsize may be present but can be avoided. Quick maneuvering may be required to avoid obstacles. Generally, children seven years and older may experience Class III rapids.</td>
					<td>Powerful rapids featuring boulder gardens, large waves and/or small waterfalls. Quick and precise maneuvering is essential to successful runs. Prior Class III experience is recommended, although aggressive first-timers looking for a challenge are generally accepted. Minimum ages will vary from 12 to 16 years.</td>
					<td> Intense and violent rapids with steep drops, waterfalls, massive waves and extremely constricted channels. Rapids may require “critical” maneuvering above dangerous hazards. Prior Class IV experience is required. In some cases participants must pass a physical fitness/swimming test administered by our guides at the river.</td>

					<td>Ideal for: Children aged seven and older, beginners to intermediates looking for manageable thrills.</td>
					<td>Ideal for: Adventurous individuals, intermediates or aggressive beginners looking for a challenge.</td>
					<td>Ideal for: Experienced paddlers and hard-core adventurers. On some rivers you’ll be required to take a physical fitness/swimming test. </td>
